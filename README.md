Coursework Activity
======================================================================
Copyright University of London.

Part of the [Double Marking Project led by UCL](https://www.catalyst-eu.net/blog/2025/04/29/enhancing-assessment-in-moodle-the-double-marking-project)
This is allowing us to take a blank slate approach about what the ideal marker experience should look like.
We are also contributing some of this functionality into core Moodle Assignment, see:
- https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-86005
- https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-64118

The Coursework Activity has been written to provide a way to receive coursework and have it marked without teachers knowing which student the work belongs to. Multiple markers are also supported where a final grade can be agreed based on several options. It does not replace the standard assignment activity and is intended to work alongside it.
Special thanks to Royal Veterinary College and [@aspark21](https://github.com/aspark21), Plymouth University, London School of Tropical Medicine and University of London International Programmes for funding parts of the development and documentation.

**November 2019** - Features funded by UoLIA

* Moodle 3.5 & Moodle 3.6 compatibility
* small bug fixes
* GDPR added

New features:

* Moodle groups access restrictions- the markers will have access to submissions belonging to Moodle groups they are allocated to. If 'Assessor from Moodle course group assigned to Stage 1' option from 'Marking workflow->Assessor allocation strategy' is chosen, the first marking stage will be automatically allocated to a tutor who is the part of the group 

* Moodle Groups can be filtered on the grading page when enabled in 'Common module settings', 'Group mode'  NOTE: When group filtering on the coursework marking page is applied, ALL available marks will be released (as if the filter wasn't applied), not only those visible on the page.

* Rubric support - Coursework now supports offline Rubic grading ('Export grading sheet', 'Upload grading worksheet'). Rubric marks will also appear in 'Export final grades' download. 

* Plagiarism Identification - Markers will be able to set a flag (mark) for students identified for plagiarism. This can be enabled in Coursework settings 'Submissions->Enable Plagiarism flagging'.  The plagiarism marking has 4 flags: 
    - Under Investigation - this will prevent release of grades and feedbacks
    - Release (no action taken)
    - Cleared: Release Results
    - Not Cleared: Withhold Results -  this will prevent release of grades and feedbacks
