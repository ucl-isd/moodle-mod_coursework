Feature: Multiple assessors simple grading form

    As a teacher
    I want there to be a simple grading form
    So that I can give students a grade and a feedback comment without any frustrating extra work

  Background:
    Given there is a course
    And the following "permission overrides" exist:
            | capability                      | permission | role    | contextlevel | reference |
            | mod/coursework:editinitialgrade | Allow      | teacher | Course       | C1        |
    And there is a coursework
    And the coursework "numberofmarkers" setting is "2" in the database
    And the coursework "allocationenabled" setting is "0" in the database
    And there is a student
    And the student has a submission

  @javascript
  Scenario: Grade and comments can be saved
    Given I am logged in as a teacher
    And the submission is finalised
    And I visit the coursework page
    And I expand the coursework grading row
    And I click on the only interactable link with title "New feedback"
    And I set the field "Grade" to "52"
    And I set the feedback comment to "Some new comment 3"
    And I click on "Save and finalise" "button"
    And I wait until "OK" "button" exists
    And I visit the edit feedback page
    And the field "Grade" matches value "52"
    And the field "Comment" matches value "Some new comment 3"
