Feature: Collisions: two people try to create feedback at the same time

    As a teacher
    I want to see a warning message if I try to save my feedback when another
    teacher has already done so
    So that I do not get a surprise when the grades I have awarded disappear

  Background:
    Given there is a course
    And there is a coursework
    And there is a student
    And the student has a submission
    And the submission is finalised

  @javascript
  Scenario: Single marker: If I submit feedback and it's already been given then the form should show a warning
    Given there is a teacher
    And there is another teacher
    And I am logged in as the other teacher
    And the coursework is set to single marker
    When I visit the coursework page
    And I have an assessor feedback at grade 67
    And I click the new single final feedback button for the student
    And I should see "Allocatable already has feedback for this stage"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Multiple marker: If I submit feedback and it's already been given then it should be given a new stage_identifier
    Given there is a teacher
    And there is another teacher
    And I am logged in as the other teacher
    And the coursework is set to double marker
    And I have an assessor feedback at grade 67
    And I visit the coursework page
    And I expand the coursework grading row
    And I click on the only interactable link with title "New feedback"
    And I grade the submission as 56 using the ajax form

  @javascript
  Scenario: Multiple marker: If I submit feedback and it's already been given by all teachers then it should fail
    Given there is a teacher
    And there is another teacher
    And I am logged in as a manager
    And the coursework is set to double marker
    When I visit the coursework page
    And I have an assessor feedback at grade 67
    And there is final feedback from the other teacher with grade 45
    And I expand the coursework grading row
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I click on the only interactable link with title "New feedback"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I wait "2" seconds
    And I should see "Allocatable already has feedback for this stage"
