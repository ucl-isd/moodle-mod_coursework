Feature: Adding and editing single feedback

    In order to provide students with a fair final grade that combines the component grades
    As a course leader
    I want to be able to edit the final grade via a form

  Background:
    Given there is a course
    And there is a coursework
    And the coursework "numberofmarkers" setting is "1" in the database
    And there is a student
    And there is a teacher
    And the student has a submission
    And the teacher has a capability to edit their own initial feedbacks
    And I log in as the teacher

  @javascript
  Scenario: Setting the final feedback grade and comment
    Given the submission is finalised
    And the coursework deadline has passed
    And I visit the coursework page
    When I click the new single final feedback button for the student
    And I grade the submission as 56 using the ajax form
    Then I visit the coursework page
    And I should see the final grade as 56 on the single marker page
    And I click the edit final feedback button
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And the field "Grade" matches value "56"
    And the grade comment textarea field matches "New comment"

  Scenario: I should not see the feedback icon when the submission has not been finalised
    And I visit the coursework page
    Then I should not see a link to add feedback

  @javascript
  Scenario: Editing someone else's grade
    Given the submission is finalised
    And there is feedback for the submission from the teacher
    And I visit the coursework page
    When I click the edit final feedback button
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And the field "Grade" matches value "58"
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And the field with xpath "//textarea[@id='id_feedbackcomment']" matches value "Blah"
